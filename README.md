# Auto-generated Test Document

This file is generated for E2E parsing.

**Document ID:** z72u0gx5jt-mnen2jpl

This document contains a variety of concise, self-contained code examples across multiple programming languages, demonstrating common patterns, data structures, I/O, and control flow to exercise parsing in a realistic yet compact way.

Each example includes a short description followed by a fenced code block.

Where helpful, examples may include brief variations in syntax or structure so the parser encounters a wider range of constructs across different ecosystems.

## Julia: Comprehension

Julia list comprehension generating cubes of a range.

```julia
nums = 1:5
cubes = [n^3 for n in nums]
println(cubes)
```


## Elixir: Enum Pipeline

Elixir pipeline that filters even numbers and inspects the result.

```elixir
nums = 1..10 |> Enum.to_list()
evens = Enum.filter(nums, fn n -> rem(n, 2) == 0 end)
IO.inspect(evens)
```


## C#: LINQ Query

Filters and projects a sequence using C# LINQ. Demonstrates expressive collection manipulation.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Linq;
class Program {
  static void Main(){
    var nums = new[]{1,2,3,4,5};
    var squares = nums.Where(n=>n%2==1).Select(n=>n*n);
    Console.WriteLine(string.Join(",", squares));
  }
}
```
